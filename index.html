        <p class="yellow"> <em>Kazakhstan</em>, officially the Republic of Kazakhstan, is a <strong>transcontinentals</strong> country mainly located in Central Asia with a smaller portion west of the Ural River in Eastern Europe. It covers a land area of <strong>2,724,900 square</strong> kilometres (1,052,100 sq mi), and shares land borders with Russia in the north, China in the east, and Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan in the south while also adjoining a large part of the Caspian Sea in the southwest. Kazakhstan does not border Mongolia, although they are only 37 kilometers apart.</p>

        <p>Charyn Canyon (also known as Sharyn Canyon) is a canyon on the Sharyn River in Kazakhstan (200 kilometres (120 mi) east of Almaty, close to the Chinese border). The canyon is roughly 90 kilometres (56 mi) in length.[1] It is part of the Charyn National Park (established on 23 February 2004), and is located within the territory of the Uygur District, Raiymbek District and Enbekshikazakh District (of the Almaty Province). Over time, the canyon has gained colorful formations of varying shapes and sizes. Though it is much smaller than the Grand Canyon, it has been described as being equally impressive. </p>

            Beautiful and rich Akmola region, an ancient land of an ancient people. Like a fairy eagle, that has widely spread its wings for the flight, it stretches itself in the north of the republic. Fruitful soils, numerous rivers and lakes, vast pastures, rich metal deposits, generous gifts of the woods, abundance of game-animals and fish have attracted people here from times immemorial. Lakes, rivers, and streams make the region unique.

            Lake Kaindy is located in the south of Kazakhstan, within Kolsay Lakes National Park. It is located 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level, 130 kilometres (81 mi) east of Almaty. The lake was formed as the result of a major limestone landslide triggered by the 1911 Kebin earthquake forming a natural dam. It blocked the gorge and was filled by mountain river water.<br> Lake Kaindy is about 400 meters long, reaching depths of nearly 30 meters at its deepest point. <br>Altered by limestone deposits, the water maintains a bluish-green color.
